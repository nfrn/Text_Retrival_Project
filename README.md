# Text_Retrival_Project

* Network which uses the https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ ,
need to download glove.6B.zip, because it uses: "glove.6B.100d.txt"
* Please install the Keras with GPU support, need also CUDA, it's way faster :)
* It is not working correctly but it is working.
* Needs to use also the validation data
* Needs to change the NN structure/layers
* Good aproach to implement https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/2761153.pdf
